## Section 2: Cost Distribution

### Cost by Capability Tower

**What it shows**: IT spend grouped by TBM Framework v5.0.1 capability towers.

**11 Capability Towers**:
1. **Compute** - Servers, VMs, containers
2. **Storage** - Storage arrays, backup systems
3. **Network** - Networking infrastructure
4. **Data** - Databases and data platforms
5. **Security** - Security tools and systems
6. **End User** - Desktop, laptop, mobile devices
7. **Facilities** - Data center space, power, cooling
8. **Risk & Compliance** - GRC tools
9. **IoT** - Internet of Things infrastructure
10. **Blockchain** - Blockchain infrastructure
11. **Quantum** - Quantum computing resources

**Example**:
```
Compute:        $45,000  (35.8%)  ███████████
Storage:        $25,000  (19.9%)  ██████
Network:        $15,000  (12.0%)  ████
Data:           $20,450  (16.3%)  █████
Security:       $10,000   (8.0%)  ███
Other:          $10,000   (8.0%)  ███
```

**How to interpret**:
- **Compute dominance**: Normal for most organizations (30-40%)
- **Storage growth**: Monitor data retention policies
- **Security spend**: Should be 5-15% of total IT budget

**Typical Distribution**:
```
Production:     70-80%  (should be majority)
Staging:        10-15%  (reasonable buffer)
Development:     5-10%  (keep lean)
DR:              5-10%  (insurance cost)
```

**Red Flags**:
- **Dev > 20%**: Investigate idle resources
- **Staging > 20%**: Consider reducing test environment size
- **DR < 5%**: May not have adequate business continuity

**Actions**:
